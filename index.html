        <p> 
          I was born the US, but moved overseas before I was six months old, and grew up in 10 different countries.  I graduated High School from Singapore American School, as did my wife.  We had the wonderful opportunity to see the world and grow up as third culture kids. I've visited over 100 counties (some that don't even exist anymore!).

            One of the biggest things I've ever been a part of in my life was my part in building the first F-35 5th generation fighter.</br>  
            The team I led was the final systems test team before the software and hardware on the actual jet was certified to fly.  My team and I lined the runway for the very first flight of the F-35A, and it felt so awesome to see it lift off and begin it's maiden flight.

            I've ridden motorcycles for more than 35 years, and love touring around the country on my favorite bike, my Yamaha FJR1300 Sport Touring bike.</br>  
            I haven't done an Iron Butt event yet, but I have ridden more than 300 miles through the rain!  While it might be nice to say I did it, I will say it really sucked trying to dry out after that ride.

            I'm a huge music fan, and pretty much love all genres.  I feel that music is the modern interpretation of what classical poetry was.  The main difference is that there are songs where the music sound alone drives the emotion, or sometimes the lyrics do, but the true height of this art is when both work together to elicit feelings in those that are watching.  It is truly amazing to find the song where the sound alone brings you alive, and then when you add the lyrics that we can relate to, it truly takes the music to a completely different level, and gives the listener a moment where their thoughts are driven in the direction of the song and the true meaning becomes clear.
