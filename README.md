## Developer's Notes

This application is being deployed with missing acceptance criteria.
After discussions in class, I made the decision to get through the HTML and CSS challenges as quickly as possible, in order to address the more crucial JavaScript challenges.  I look forward to those opportunities.

## Additional Note

While this note is more applicable to the 1st challenge, I did want to say that part of my time issue was the lack of ability to upload my submissions.  

When I started the Pre-work for the course, I actually had 2 pre-works in my courses section on Canvas.  One of them had the name of the course and nothing else.  The second one had the name of the course, but that name was preceeded by 'UTSA'.  I asked about this (I don't remember who I emailed) and was told either would be fine. I do know that at least one other student had the same issue.

Apparently that is not the case.  I did the one without UTSA at the beginning.  After learning of my mistake, I had to go back through the whole pre-work.  The reason was that in addition to there being some information that was different I had to do the sections on the 'UTSA' version in order to unlock sections and links within canvas.  And in order to get those links, you have to go through page by page, ensuring that you enter info in the fields shown and so forth.  

My Canvas pages had none of the links or areas that I needed in order to submit homework.  There was no Syllabus, Grades, Announcements, and so on on the left of my Courses/Dashboard home page I had nothing to click on.  No information about this specific course session.

I'm not listing this out to make and excuse how this affected my not completely meeting all the acceptance criteria for this challenge.
I felt that this information was important to pass on, so that no students in the future have to go through the same thing.

## One More Additonal Note

The color pallete that was chosen was merely an attempt to make this as ugly-colored as I possibly could. ;-)
